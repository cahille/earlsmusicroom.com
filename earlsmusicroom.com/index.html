<div><b>Earl's Music Room</b><br><br></div>
<div>
Earl's Music Room (EMR) is both an actual room in Earl Cahill's actual home and a virtual room that could be anywhere in the world. The vision is that musicians come to EMR to perform and talk about music. EMR is also a YouTube channel where the 
videos can be viewed. At least to start, EMR will focus on piano music.
</div>
<br><br>
<div>
<b>Goals</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
Here are some goals of EMR in no particular order
<ul>
  <li>provide performers with awesome recordings that they can use to help get exposure and performing opportunities</li>
  <li>give Earl an opportunity to perform and talk about music</li>
  <li>humanize music, showing that music is produced and consumed by humans</li>
  <li>get to meet awesome musicians from around the world</li>
  <li>visit some awesome locales</li>
  <li>generally broaden the audience for classical music</li>
</ul>
<br>
</div>
<!--<div>
<b>Virtual EMR</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
For the virtual room, Earl would travel to an awesome locale, and record several pianists performing and talking about a program or more of music. Earl would anticipate spending about a week in the locale, with the days looking like this
  <ul>
    <li>2-3 days recording performances</li>
    <li>1-2 days recording interviews about music</li>
    <li>1 day recording timelapses</li>
    <li>1 day editing and finalizing</li>
  </ul>
So that's 5-7 days total. The goal is that Earl will leave a locale with several hours of content all edited and uploaded to YouTube or ready to upload, depending on broadband availability. The interviews might have to be finalized later,
but the goal is to get as much done as possible before leaving the locale.

<div>
<b>Performances</b><br>
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>you can have as many takes as you want and you can pick your favorite. For example, if you play a three movement sonata, you could play each movement several times, pick your favorite take for each movement and those favorite takes would end up in EMR. 
    I want the granularity to be a piece. I don't want to try and splice in single notes or record a coda or the like separately and then edit it in later</li>
    <li>audio recorded with two <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/365856-REG/Audix_SCX25A_PS_SCX_25A_Piano_Microphone_System.html" target="_blank">Audix SCX25A-PS</a></li>
    <li>audio recorded to a <a href=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1140426-REG/zoom_zf8_f8_field_recorder.html target="_blank">Zoom F8</a></li>
    <li>video recorded with four to eight cameras, largely depending on the latest and greatest that Earl has purchased</li>
    <li>video edited live using a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1335026-REG/blackmagic_design_swatemtvstu_prohd_atem_television_studio_pro.html" target="_blank">Blackmagic Design ATEM Television Studio Pro HD Live Production Switcher</a></li>
    <li>entire performance filming process will be streamed as bandwidth permits</li>
    <li>conservatively, I would plan on about three or four hours to record an hour of music</li>
    <li>Earl will have final say for what gets made public. Realize that we will do complete takes for pieces and it is hard to get everything perfect. For sure I don't demands for perfection to stop pretty
    awesome recordings from going public. But yeah, gotta hit a quite high quality level because I want to have great content on the channel, It will be a delicate balance :)</li>
  </ul>
<br>
</div>

<div>
<b>Performer preparation</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
Ideally, the performer would just show up and play, but I am convinced that to have success, we need to do more than that. There are a few things that the performer may likely do just for the purposes of EMR, but the hope is that such effort will pay off.
  <ul>
    <li>be patient and be a good sport. Even <i>very</i> talented jerks aren't really welcome in EMR :) Making great recordings takes time</li>
    <li>have an thirty or more minutes worth of music. Generally I like the idea of this being a recital, i.e., pieces that fit well together. If the performer has other pieces to play we could record those as well. Or, a performer could record the start of the week,
    take a few days to prepare more and record towards the end of the week as well</li>
    <li>have your music to the level where you would perform it in a competition or professional recital</li>
    <li>be prepared to speak about what you love about your music, for example</li>
      <ul>
        <li>how did you become acquainted with the piece</li>
        <li>why did you choose to learn it</li>
        <li>how long have you worked on the piece</li>
        <li>what are some parts of the piece that were difficult to learn</li>
        <li>what are some parts of the piece you love</li>
        <li>what are some interesting circumstances surrounding the composition of the piece</li>
      </ul>
    <li>keep in mind that a channel consisting solely of performances will not likely be amazingly interesting or sticky</li>
    <li>keep in mind that your non-performance videos may (ironically) lead to more fame and opportunities than the performances themselves</li>
    <li>a party trick (see below)</li>
    <li>a "popular" piece(s) (see below)</li>
    <li>a timelapse piece (see below)</li>
    <li>it might be good to bring a music confidant that you trust that would listen to the performances and give feedback. Earl will give feedback but he will also be managing the recording</li>
    <li>have places around your city in mind for backdrops when talking about music</li>
    <li>opinions - just like a Bach Partita wouldn't be very interesting if every note was given equal value, saying that you like all composers or each moment of your program equally isn't super interesting :) I understand the desire for exactness, but 
    fight through it and say something</li>
  </ul>
<br>
</div>

<div>
<b>Terms</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
Some few terms
  <ul>
    <li>Earl will cover all of his expenses</li>
    <li>performers will not be paid for performing</li>
    <li>Earl (through Skepteon Media) will own the recordings</li>
    <li>performers can link to the videos however they like</li>
    <li>at the performer's request, Earl will make pieces from a single camera available for auditions, etc.</li>
    <li>Earl will add playlists for the performer's performances and interviews</li>
    <li>eventually YouTube ads will aim to recoup Earl's expenses. Before EMR gets 1,000 subscribers, Earl won't make a dime from YouTube ad revenue</li>
    <li>Earl will publicize awesome piano videos through his various social media accounts</li>
    <li>performers should publicize their videos through their various social media accounts</li>
    <li>performers should subscribe to the EMR channel :)</li>
    <li>generally one of the performers will provide an interesting venue with an awesome piano</li>
    <li>Earl will plan on taking still photos of the performer to be used to aid video thumbnails. The performers may use said stills as they wish</li>
    <li>Earl would be happy to link to the performer's site in the YouTube videos</li>
    <li>current plan is that the "popular" and "timelapse" pieces will appear on Earl's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_Yq-hCQ9kmCiNdDeIrbgA" target="_blank">CameraPanda</a>
       YouTube channel (which currently has over 16,000 subscribers), and link to the EMR channel</li>
    <li>all pieces will appear on the EMR channel which currently has 11 subscribers :)</li>
  </ul
<br>
<br>
</div>

<div><b>Repertoire</b><br><br></div>
<div>
Come prepared with basically whatever you have in your fingers. Duplication from other performers is fine, but to start it would be great to have breadth before depth. It would also be great to cover the pillars of classical piano.
There are MANY great pieces not listed here, but some examples include
  <ul>
    <li>Bach &middot; English Suites, French Suites, Goldberg Variations, Inventions, Partitas, Sinfonias, Toccatas, WTC</li>
    <li>Barber &middot; Excursions, Sonata</li>
    <li>Beethoven &middot; Piano Sonatas</li>
    <li>Brahms &middot; Opp. 116-119</li>
    <li>Chopin &middot; Ballades, Barcarolle, Etudes, Nocturnes, Polonaise, Preludes, Scherzos, Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3, Waltzes</li>
    <li>Debussy &middot; Children's Corner, Preludes</li>
    <li>Haydn &middot; Piano Sonatas</li>
    <li>Liszt &middot; Annees de pelerinage, Hungarian Rhapsodies, Paganini Etudes, Sonata in B Minor, Transcendental Etudes</li>
    <li>Mozart &middot; Piano Sonatas</li>
    <li>Mussorgsky &middot; Pictures at an Exhibition</li>
    <li>Prokofiev &middot; Piano Sonatas</li>

    <li>Schumann &middot; Carnaval, Kreisleriana, Scenes from Childhood, Sonatas, Symphonic Etudes</li>
    <li>Scriabin &middot; Piano Sonatas</li>
    <li>Shostakovich &middot; Preludes and Fugues</li>
    <li>Stravinski &middot; Petrouchka</li>
    <li>Vine &middot; Sonata No. 1</li>
  </ul>
<br>
</div>

<div>
<b>Party tricks</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
Party tricks are something fun and impressive you can do that is music related but that you wouldn't likely do in a recital. It is likely that party tricks are practiced ahead of time, perhaps just for EMR. Some party trick examples include
  <ul>
    <li>right hand for left hand and vice versa - not some Scarlatti-like hand crossing, but imagine playing a Chopin etude with your hands crossed</li>
    <li>play backwards - start at the end of your piece and play the score backwards, observing rhythms, dynamics, etc.</li>
    <li>right hand one piece, left hand a different piece</li>
    <li>only right / left hand, start to finish</li>
    <li>fun improvisation, for example, in the style of a composer, or in the style of a piece</li>
    <li>look at score for a new piece, put score down, play piece</li>
    <li>write out a portion of your piece from memory</li>
    <li>fun or amazing warm up</li>
    <li>amazingly fast technique (scales, arpeggios, Hanon, Czerny, etc.)</li>
    <li>play a score with multiple staves, like SATB or orchestral</li>
    <li>4'33" challenge - given a time period, like a minute, tell me when it has passed</li>
    <li>an interesting perfect pitch demonstration</li>
    <li>drop the needle quiz - Earl drops the needle on some music and you identify it ASAP
    <li>playing blindfolded</li>
  </ul>
<br>
</div>

<div>
<b>"Popular" pieces</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
If EMR is going to have success folks need to find it and what better way to find it than by having pieces that folks are looking for. Just because a piece is "popular" does not mean it is bad music. It isn't the piece's fault that folks like it :) It is important
that everything you perform for EMR is something you love, including this piece. I am open to other pieces, but some examples
  <ul>
    <!--<li>Chopin &middot; Berceuse in D-flat Major, Op. 57</li>-->
    <!--<li>Chopin &middot; Etude in E Major Op. 10, No. 3</li>-->
    <!--<li>Schumann &middot; Of Foreign Lands and Peoples from <i>Scenes from Childhood</i></li>-->
    <!--<li>Schumann &middot; Träumerei from <i>Scenes from Childhood</i></li>-->
    <li>Bach &middot; Aria from <i>Goldberg Variations</i>, Inventions Nos. 4, 8, 13, Prelude in C major, BWV 846</li>
    <li>Beethoven &middot; 'Appassionata' Sonata, 'Moonlight' Sonata, 'Pathetique' Sonata, Fur Elise</li>
    <li>Brahms &middot; Intermezzo in B-flat Minor Op. 117, No. 2, Intermezzo in A Major Op. 118, No. 2</li>
    <li>Chopin &middot; Fantaisie-Impromptu, 'Heroic' Polonaise, 'Raindrop' Prelude, March Funebre, Minute Waltz, Nocturne in E-flat Major Op. 9, No. 2</li>
    <li>Debussy &middot; Clair de Lune, Deux arabesques, Pagodes from <i>Estampes</i>, Reverie</li>
    <li>Dvorak &middot; Humoresque</li>
    <li>Liszt &middot; Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, La Campanella, Un Sospiro</li>
    <li>Mozart &middot; Rondo alla Turca</li>
    <li>Ravel &middot; Pavane pour une infante defunte</li>
    <li>Rimsky-Korsakov &middot; Flight of the Bumblebee</li>
    <li>Satie &middot; Gymnopedie No. 1</li>
    <li>Schumann &middot; Arabeske, Op. 18 (performed by <a href=https://youtu.be/Wj9gvE7AFrs>Anna Han</a>)</li>
    <li>Wild-Gershwin &middot; Seven Virtuoso Etudes</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
</div>


<div>
<b>a timelapse piece</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>Earl is a big fan of shooting timelapses and would like to put music to timelapses, kind of like he did <a href="https://youtu.be/5kVtBSTOkZM" target="_blank">here</a>. The piece will likely just be selected from the performer's normal repertoire. 
Generally, these pieces would be fast and under two minutes, but I am open to suggestions. The timelapse video would likely have to be completely after leaving the locale. The Hong Kong timelapses were shot over parts of, I believe, three or four 
days and nights.<br><br>
The timelapse piece would include some shots of the performer, not just timelapses :)
<br><br></div>

<div>
<b>Concept albums</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
I like the idea of the concept album, so this is a place holder for some possibilities
  <ul>
    <li>Mussorgsky &middot; Pictures at an Exhibition - the performance is interspersed with video matching the program of the piece</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
<b>Desired programs</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
Here are a few programs that I would be pretty thrilled to film
  <ul>
    <li>Beethoven  &middot; Opp. 109, 110, 111 - is there a more desired solo piano program? Not for EMR :)</li>
    <li>Bach &middot; Partita No. 6, Beethoven &middot; Op. 110, Chopin &middot; Ballade No. 4 - one my favorite piano recitals ever</li>
    <li>Beethoven  &middot; - 'Moonlight', 'Pathetique', 'Appassionata' Sonatas - one of the classical music gateway albums from my youth</li>
    <li>Prokofiev Sonatas Nos. 6, 7 and 8</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
<b>Checklist</b>
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>record performances</li>
    <li>record piece introductions</li>
    <li>record interview</li>
    <li>capture still for video thumbnails</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
<b>EMR comes to you</b><br><br>
</div>
<div>
I would be thrilled if a group of excellent pianists reached out to have me to have me come record them. Here's a few things I would need
  <ul>
    <li>A recording venue. Ideally I could stay a place that has an excellent piano, or there's a place where I could setup and leave my equipment. It takes a good three or four hours to get everything ready and I wouldn't want to start my day setting things up and 
    end my day taking things day, only to repeat the process the next day</li>
    <li>Four-ish excellent pianists, each with a recital program(ish)</li>
    <li>Perhaps some universities would invite me out and provide a recital hall for a few days</li>
    <li>An interesting location. Rome anyone? Prague, London, Beijing, Vienna, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Seoul? Los Angeles?</li>
    <li>A local assistant to help setup and put away camera equipment</li>
  </ul>
